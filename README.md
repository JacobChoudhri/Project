# Project
The attached Jupyter notebooks to this Readme.md will serve the purpose of teaching the user how to use SQL , a data query language, on relational database management systems. Specifically using the language in order to fetch specific data from a database or update the database it seld. SQL which stands for "Structured Query Language" is one of the most heavily used languages in the finance and BI sphere. This learning series will take you through three seperate notebooks leveling at Beginner, Intermediate, and finally Advanced. All of which will focus on a specific set of skills with sandboxs and tasks to practice your skills.


## Table of Contents

The following is a table of contents of all of the topics that will be covered throughout this SQL learning series:




## DQL
DQL, or Data Query Language, is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that focuses specifically on retrieving and querying data from a database. Understanding DQL and its role is essential for extracting meaningful insights and information from the Superstore dataset. In this project, you will likely use DQL extensively to analyze and extract insights from the Superstore dataset. You'll write DQL queries to fetch information about orders, customers, regional managers, returned items, and other relevant aspects. By leveraging DQL's capabilities, you can gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, uncover trends, and identify patterns.

### Notebooks in DQL

* Beginner Notebook
* Intermediate Notebook
* Advanced Notebook


## DML
DML, or Data Manipulation Language, is a subset of SQL that focuses on modifying and manipulating data within a database. In the context of this project, understanding DML and its role is crucial for making changes to the Superstore dataset, such as inserting new data, updating existing data, and deleting unwanted data. The primary DML commands that allow you to interact with the data in these tables are : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

### Notebooks in DML



## DDL
DDL, or Data Definition Language, is another subset of SQL that focuses on defining and managing the structure of a database. In the context of your project, understanding DDL and its role is crucial for creating and modifying the database schema that holds the Superstore dataset. DDL provides a set of commands that allow you to define and manipulate database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. Certain commands used are: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
